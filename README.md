# LCHS WorkMaster
> *"Not a generic to-do list app."* - **Apricitine**

## What is it?
LCHS WorkMaster is a PWA (Progressive Web Application) that allows you to create and manage to-do with the unique ability to sync with Google Classroom, Google Tasks, and Google Calendar. It provides helpful insights and notifications to help you manage your school workload with ease and improve your productivity. 
## How do I use it?
The app is accessible at [apricitine.github.io/lchs-workmaster](https://apricitine.github.io/lchs-workmaster). If you don't want to have to keep opening it, the service is also available as a [Chrome Extension](). Once you're on the app, you can sign in with your Google account to connect the app to your Google Classroom, Google Tasks, and Google Calendar.
## Build specs
This app was made with Vue using the Vite bundler. I used typescript because it's the best, and also Sass. It actually counts as a fullstack pwa because it uses firebase.
